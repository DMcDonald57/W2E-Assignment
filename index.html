    <h1>Yankee Stadium, Bronx New York</h1>
    </header>

        <section>
        <p> The New York Yankees have had two playing fields that they have called
        home.  The first was built in 1923 and has since been replaced with 
        there second permanent home in 2009.  The second Yankee stadium was 
        built next door to the original and still calls the Bronx its home.  
        It cost $2.3 billion to build and is the third largest stadium in the 
        MLB by seating capacity.  It retained many of the features from the 
        original building to maintain it historical past.
