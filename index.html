    <h1>Yankee Stadium, Bronx New York</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
        <p> The New York Yankees have had two playing fields that they have called
            home.  The first was built in 1923 and has since been replaced with 
            there second permanent home in 2009.  The second Yankee stadium was 
            built next door to the original and still calls the Bronx its home.  
            It cost $2.3 billion to build and is the third largest stadium in the 
            MLB by seating capacity.  It retained many of the features from the 
            original building to maintain it historical past.
